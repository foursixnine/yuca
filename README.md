# yuca

Yuca: A light-weight, in-memory, fast and simple to use search engine library.

If your app can't handle installing full featured and heavy engines like Lucene, nor you want to depend on a SQL database for indexing and doing simple search based strings you can use Yuca to index documents under any number of arbitrary keys which can be grouped under tags.

GOALS:
 - JNI/Java bindings
 - Javascript/NodeJS bindings
 - Python bindings
 - Go bindings
 - PHP bindings
